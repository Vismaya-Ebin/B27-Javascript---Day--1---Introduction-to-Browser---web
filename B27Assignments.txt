3)Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


1)
a)*Statically Typed Languages (Java,C,C++)    :

	   >Type of the variable is known at compile time.
	   >we should declare the type of the variable
	   >eg:) int data = 20;
	   >Errors are caught at early stage of development
   
  *Dynamically Typed Languages(JS,python,Ruby):
  
	   >Type of the variable is known at run time;
	   >we dont want to declare data type;
	   >eg:)data = 20;
	   >No compilation stsge
  
b)*Scripting languages                                                   

	  >All Scripting languages are  programming languages             		
	  >It doesnot create .exe executable files   					  		
	  >Divided in to server side scripting language and client side scripting language
	  >It reads and analyse code line by line,if error detected	it stop addressing them one by one,hence its slow
	  >Less memory required as no executables generated				  		
	  >eg)JS , Ruby, Python
  
  *Programming languages  
 
	 >All programming languages are not scripting languages
	 >On compilation it generate .exe files that take memory
	 >It is sub divided in to 1stGen,2ndGen,3rdGen,4thGen,5thGen.
	 >Compiler reads and analyse the code once and collectievly take the errors,hence fast.
	 >Less memory effiecient(take additionaltime to trastlate source code to machine code)
	 > eg)C,C#,Java

3)  HTTP1.1

    >Page load takes time
	>Single request at a time.
	>Page load slowly
	
	
	HTTP 2
	
	>Page load speed improved
	>Compresstion of request headers and payload
	>Multiple request can be sent over a single TCP connection.
	>Able to download web files asynchronosly from web server
	>website load faseter
	>Convert text in to binary format before transfering over network
